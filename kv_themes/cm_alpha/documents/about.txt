Deriving creative inspiration from her Midwestern roots, C.M. began her formal ad hoc film studies at the University of Missouri, Columbia where she majored in Interdisciplinary Studies, focusing on film, photography, creative writing, and French. This is also when she got her first real taste of filmmaking working as a PA on the set of <i>Mil Mascaras vs. the Aztec Mummy</i> starring the iconic luchador, Mil Mascaras. She went on to earn her Master’s degree in Interdisciplinary Studies from The University of Texas at El Paso, where she focused on directing, writing, foreign languages and culture. During this time, C.M. experienced the eye-opening dichotomy of the El Paso, TX—Ciudad Juarez area during the height of cartel violence from 2007 to 2009. This period often influences her work. She also traveled extensively, accruing stories from around the globe. This included a study abroad semester with the New York Film Academy in Abu Dhabi in 2008.

She also collaborated with renowned poet and Afro-Caribbean folklore scholar, Anand Prahlad, to write and direct <i>The Blue Cat</i>, which screened at the El Paso International Film Festival in 2009. In 2010 she returned to El Paso to direct <i>Earth, Polis, Agua</i>, a short documentary examining water usage in the tri-border area.
