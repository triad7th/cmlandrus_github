#FEFEFE;mso-shading:windowtext;mso-pattern:solid white'>After coming to Los
Angeles to work as a writer and director, I quickly realized that even though I
had all the creative and technical skills needed to make a film, I knew nothing
about the whole process that gets a film from an idea to a screen. I began educating
myself through film production and entrepreneurship classes and was able to
realize that there was an entire process that so many struggling independent
filmmakers knew nothing about, and it was prohibiting them from moving their
projects forward. </p>

#FEFEFE;mso-shading:windowtext;mso-pattern:solid white'>I began applying
different business techniques and entrepreneurial models to the projects I was
working on. I found out that the entire entertainment industry had become
fragmented, leaving space for newer, younger, and more diverse talent to break
in and shape the way the industry would work in the future. However, this can
only happen if filmmakers are prepared to take their work to a competitive
level by becoming both filmmakers and businesspeople.<span
style="mso-spacerun:yes">Â  </span>As both a filmmaker and a businessperson, I
aim to help talented creators be able to take control of their projects by
bridging the two previously separated worlds of business and film.</p>
